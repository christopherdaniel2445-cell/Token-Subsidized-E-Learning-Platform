# 📚 Token-Subsidized E-Learning Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 solution for bridging the education gap in remote areas! This project creates a decentralized e-learning platform where global donors fund subsidies through tokens, enabling affordable or free access to quality education for underserved communities. Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, it ensures transparency, immutability, and efficient distribution of funds while incentivizing content creators and learners.

The platform addresses real-world problems like limited access to education in remote or low-income regions due to high costs, lack of infrastructure, and funding inefficiencies. By leveraging blockchain, donations are tracked transparently, subsidies are automated, and tokens reward participation—reducing administrative overhead and corruption risks.

## ✨ Features

🔄 Token-based subsidies for course access in remote areas  
💰 Global donor funding with transparent tracking  
📖 Decentralized course creation and management  
🏆 Rewards for learners and educators upon completion  
🌍 Location verification for subsidy eligibility (using oracles)  
📊 Governance for community-driven fund allocation  
🔒 Secure token staking for long-term donor commitments  
📈 Analytics for impact reporting and donor insights  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Donors**  
- Contribute tokens (e.g., STX or custom fungible tokens) to the donation pool.  
- Stake tokens for yields or voting rights in governance.  
- View real-time analytics on how funds are used for subsidies and rewards.  

**For Learners in Remote Areas**  
- Register and verify eligibility (e.g., via geolocation oracle).  
- Enroll in courses with subsidized or free access using platform tokens.  
- Complete modules to earn rewards and certificates on-chain.  

**For Educators/Content Creators**  
- Upload and manage courses securely.  
- Earn tokens based on learner engagement and completions.  

**Overall Flow**  
1. Donors fund the system via the Donation Contract.  
2. Funds are pooled and distributed as subsidies through automated rules.  
3. Learners access content, with subsidies covering costs.  
4. Governance allows stakeholders to vote on improvements.  
5. All transactions are immutable and verifiable on the blockchain.  

This setup involves 8 smart contracts written in Clarity, ensuring modularity, security, and scalability.
